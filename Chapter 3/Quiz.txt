Solution: 1: MongoDB can store duplicate documents in the same collection, as long as their _id values are different.
          2: If a document is inserted without a provided _id value, then the _id field and value will be automatically generated for the inserted document before insertion.


=====> Quiz: Insert Order

          2: db.pets.insert([{ "_id": 1, "pet": "cat" },
                { "_id": 2, "pet": "dog" },
                { "_id": 3, "pet": "fish" },
                { "_id": 3, "pet": "snake" }])

          3: db.pets.insert([{ "_id": 1, "pet": "cat" },
                { "_id": 1, "pet": "dog" },
                { "_id": 3, "pet": "fish" },
                { "_id": 4, "pet": "snake" }], { "ordered": false })
